            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <p class = "history-text"> Little Mix are a British girl group formed in 2011 on The X Factor UK, where they became the first group to win. Members Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jesy Nelson signed with Syco Music after their victory. Their debut album DNA (2012) reached the top 10 in the UK and US, breaking records for a British girl group. Follow-up albums Salute (2013), Get Weird (2015), and Glory Days (2016) produced multiple UK top 10 hits, including four number-one singles like “Wings,” “Black Magic,” and “Shout Out to My Ex.” Glory Days became their first UK number-one album and the longest-running girl group chart-topper since the Spice Girls. </p>
                <p class = "history-text"> The group has won numerous awards, including a Brit Award for Best British Single, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and multiple platinum certifications. With record-breaking sales, chart success, and 13 VEVO-certified videos, Little Mix are widely recognized as one of the most successful and influential girl groups of their generation. </p>
                <p class = "history-text">In the present, Little Mix are on hiatus after completing their Confetti Tour in 2022. The group continues as a trio—comprising Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jade Thirlwall—following Jesy Nelson’s departure in 2020 for personal and mental health reasons. They released the compilation album Between Us in November 2021, which does not include new contributions from Jesy, though some of her vocals are included on older tracks. Perrie and Leigh-Anne have both become mothers: Perrie welcomed a son in 2021, while Leigh-Anne has also embraced motherhood. Jade is actively pursuing a solo music career, including several new singles, and Jesy Nelson is expecting twins and continuing to work on her solo projects, though with some pregnancy-related complications.</p>
